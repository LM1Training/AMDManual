All employees are resplonsible for having high                  quality internet access in their workspace.            ♦ All software programs needed for the job are provided and all                  APCs will receive training on their use. Additional applications                  and programs may be approved through Optum.             ♦ APC positions are exempt (salaried) and this comes with the                    expectation that there will be times in which work related                  activities are done outside work hours and not compensated.                  This can include finishing up charting at the end of the work                  hours. LM1 Leadership does make every effort to schedule                  mandatory meetings and training within the APC work hours.            ♦ LM1 APCs work remotely but do have to have a registered                  residence in which they can set up a workstation that is HIPPA                  compliant. They must fill out a Telecommuter form in GSS.                  APCs will be expected to receive a desktop and a laptop is the                  exception (ie. For approved work accommodations). If an APC                  needs to work from another location, such as a summer home,                  for a month or more, they are expected to establish a HIPPA                  compliant workstation at the temporary residence and use their                  entire desktop while they are there.            ♦ APCs will be expected to remain available to take patient care                  calls and answer email triages on their work hours. Break times,                  pre-approved meetings, and approved training are the only times                  in which an APC may not be available to take calls during their                  work hours.             ♦ LM1 is a very busy company and most APCs can expect busy                    work hours, but will be taking one patient care concern at a time,                  with documenting being done before the next patient care                  concern starts. How busy an APC is during their work hours                  depends on work hours scheduled, licensing, and credentialing.","♦ It is expected that APCs will continue either working                             independently on their own licensure or work closely with Optum                             Licensing on gaining any licensure they do not have within their                             assigned LM1 sub-territory.                         ♦ Optum will provide all need software and hardware for their                             working needs.

These can be used after giving the candidate a                             better understanding of who Landmark and LM1 works and the                             UE program as well. They can be modified to fit the clinical                             acumen we want to access in the candidate.              • Occasionally there will be numerous APC interviews within a months                  time, and more APC candidates for the roles available. LM1 physicians                  will come together to rank the APC candidates and provide this                  information to Adrienne Moltz who will then work with Talent Acquisition.             • The applicant will most likely receive further information from                 Talent Acquisition.              • Optum guidance on interviews","• Bias free interviewing accessible through Knowledge Base            ▪ Decisions on interviews                         • The interviewing AMDs/DMDs will save a copy in the APC Interviews                             folder on the LM1 Doctors Teams Channel.

Reaching out just once, or not until the end of the quarter shows poor                planning and professionalism. Attempts should be made each month until                the requirement is met.             • If the APC does very few UEUVs, or has work hours outside of LM1 physician                work hours, and they have reached out consistently, they may be given an                accommodation for the quarter.    ▪ First offered to Doc of the Day if available, otherwise any AMD can perform ride      along.    ▪ AMD does NOT have to be licensed/credentialed in the patient’s state to ride      along. However, without License/credentialing, AMD is not allowed to guide clinical      care when not licensed/credentialed.    ▪ Time expectations – anticipate at least an hour to perform ride along and debrief      with APC after ride along to provide any feedback.    ▪ Many APCs will reach out with time that RAL is supposed to start, however this      usually means that is the time the UE arrives.

The LM1 physicians will come                             together to help create a master list of all APCs that includes summaries of their                             performance, GSS goal performance, Self eval, and colleague evals. Together,                             the LM1 physicians will discuss as a group and decide as a group what scores to                             give each APC and focus on having one message when it comes time for each                             physician to discuss the scores with their APCs.                       ▪ Common review scores are not immediately available to the APC (AMD/DMD)                             once submitted in GSS, and it is recommended that the manager wait till the pre-                             determined time to report these scores as they do have to pass through upper                             Landmark and then Home and Community Leadership first.

Access can be granted by Adrienne Moltz.           •           • Once granted, set to Favorites.","• Additional access will be needed to the State/Market subfolders               (~35 in total) in order to categorize and store email triages that               have been completed.             • (example)  ▪ Triage Mailbox monitoring: Occasionally LM1 physicians may be needed to        help with triage mailbox support and assign those triage emails that have      been waiting for =>55 minutes as it is our goal to call the patient back within      one hour of their first contact with LM1.             • Triage emails typically are created when a patient/caller calls LM1                and communicates with a PCC or market staff member. If the PCC                cannot find an LM1 Clinician (RN or APC) for that patient’s market                available and there is not a buzzword, the concern will be placed in                the Triage mailbox and auto assigned to the next LM1 Clinician                when they become available. Our goal is to call the patient back                within one hour.             • If the triage email is not auto assigned in 55 minutes, it will roll over                into a separate email triage box that can be monitored.                     1. Within Workspace, create a new tab by clicking the “+” ,                          Queue Activity, APP Email Escalation.                     2. This view can then be saved and named according to your                          preference, for example: “>55 minutes”.             • It is the task of the PCC lead or TL (Or LM1 phsyician) on to assign to                the next appropriate Clinician to help avoid delay, or send back to                the market for market owned management.","• It is important to have the Online Agents Genesys tab open, as well      as the Humanity schedule for the day showing all the Clinicians      working, and the RN and APC Licensing and Credentialing list to      refer to incase there is a Clinician not in the appropriate skill in      Genesys to have the email triage automatically sent to them.      If it's found that a RN or APC is not in the appropriate skill,      send an email detailing this to WFM.    •      In the lower left of the Online Agents tab will be the Mailbox      as above. It will contain the name of the PCC who took the      patient call and sent the email, the duration of time the triage      emails has been waiting, what skills are needed by the      Clinician to answer the email (call the patient back and triage      them).           1. Clicking on the skills will show to the right of the               mailbox all the Clinicians in that skill who are logged               on to Genesys at that time.             2. Here we can see who could be next in line to receive that                email triage automatically and, by comparing to Humanity                and the RN and APC Licensing and Credentialing list, who                else could be available but not skilled in that market.    • When an email triage has been in the box for 55 minutes:           1. Go “On Queue”                    1. This will route the email triage to you.                    2. Answer the email triage. This will open the                        email up.                     3. Go off Queue. (some elect to stay on Queue during                          the entirety of the time managing the box. Others                          elect to manually go on and off Queue to avoid                          getting back to back email triages sent to them that                          may cause confusion.)                    4. It is also important to have an idea of the                        schedule of the PCC you are sending the email                        triage back to and this can be found on                        Humanity or on the PCC Dashboard. If the PCC","is off or is close to the end of their shift, contact                                 the PCC Lead who can help escalate the email                                 triage to the next available PCC.                             5. Copy the patient name and ID # from the                                 subject line.                             6. Click Reply and the Include message history.                             7. Reply with “There are no LM1 Clinicians to                                    manage, please contact the daytime clinician or on                                    call provider to manage” and paste the patient                                    name and ID#.                               8. Copy the verbiage you just wrote in the reply along                                    with the patient name and ID#.                             9. Click Send.                             10. On the right column choose “Transfer to the Market                                    Provider” as the wrap up code, and close.                    2. In the LM1 Full APC and PCC Teams Channel, create a                        new post tagging the PCC you sent the email triage                        back to, and paste the body of your email response in                        the message.                             1. Flag autogenerated email in the Outlook Follow                                 up box.                             2. Make sure the PCC has acknowledged the post                                 with a thumbs up (or equivalent).                    3. In the Outlook LM1 Follow up box, once the triage                        email has been taken care of and either the patient has                        been called back and/or managed, this email can then                        be placed in the appropriate state subfolder.                    4. We can also request the market sender escalate to the                          market clinician to manage using similar language as above,                          “There are no LM1 Clinicians to manage, please escalate to                          market clinicians to manage.”                    5. If the original sender of the email triage is no longer on shift                          or not responding, Reach out to the PCC Lead on.  ▪ Monitoring a Live call in Genesys:             • Monitoring allows you to listen to an interaction without               disturbing the conversation between the agent and the               customer.
